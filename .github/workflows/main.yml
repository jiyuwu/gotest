    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build the Docker image
      run: | 
        docker version
        # 使用Dockerfile构建镜像
        # docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag Gotest:${{ github.sha }}
        for DIR in $(find -maxdepth 2 -name Dockerfile | cut -d'/' -f2); do
          echo $DIR
          echo "上面的是打印的文件：" $DIR
